# 🧠 Count-Based Word Vectors using Co-Occurrence Matrix

This project explores how to build traditional word embeddings using co-occurrence matrices, based on the idea that *“You shall know a word by the company it keeps”*.

## 📚 Dataset

We use a subset of the **Large Movie Review Dataset (IMDB)**.

## 📌 Steps Covered In Part One Of Code

1. **Tokenization and Corpus Creation** with `<START>` and `<END>` tokens
2. **Finding Distinct Words** in the corpus
3. **Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix**
4. **Dimensionality Reduction** with Truncated SVD
5. **Plotting Word Embeddings** in 2D space
6. **Clustering and Semantic Analysis**

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
