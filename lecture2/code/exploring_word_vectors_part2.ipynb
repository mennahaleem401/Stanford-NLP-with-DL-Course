You need to install some Python libraries before you can successfully do this assignment. A lot of code is provided in this notebook, and we highly encourage you to read and understand it as part of the learning :)\n",

The session will be recorded and the material will be made available on our [website](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html#schedule). The CS231N Python/Numpy [tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) is also a great resource.\n",

        "As discussed in class, more recently prediction-based word vectors have demonstrated better performance, such as word2vec and GloVe (which also utilizes the benefit of counts). Here, we shall explore the embeddings produced by GloVe. Please revisit the class notes and lecture slides for more details on the word2vec and GloVe algorithms. If you're feeling adventurous, challenge yourself and try reading [GloVe's original paper](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf).\n",

If you've run these cells before, rerunning them will load the model without redownloading it, which will take about 1 to 2 minutes."
